Home Run Derby Game Explanation:

This is a simple home run derby game I created in Processing. The goal is to hit a home run, hit the target balloon, or both. You receive one point for each home run, and one point for each target balloon hit.

You control the launch vector of the ball using the arrow keys, with the launch vector shown in yellow. A small yellow dot can be seen on the ground; this is a point directly below the tip of the launch vector, for perspective. The wind, which acts only in the XZ plane, is shown as a green vector pointing out of this dot. Once you have the launch vector in the desired position, you press enter/return to confirm.

Your goal is to either hit a home run (hit the ball over the fence between the foul lines), hit the target balloon, or both. The target balloon is blue, with a small blue dot directly underneath the center at ground level for perspective, in a similar manner to the launch vector's dot. The target balloon will be moved after each hit.

Your character's level of power can be modified using the 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 keys while moving the launch vector. Each one has a range of launch force possibilities, with a launch force randomly chosen from within the range (though it will always start at a 45-degree angle, pointed directly ahead). The categories are:
    
    1) Little Leaguer (least power)
    
    2) College Player
    
    3) MLB Player
    
    4) Babe Ruth
    
    5) God (most power)

A scoreboard at the top right shows:
    
    Your current power level
    
    Your current points
    
    The distance traveled by your last hit

You can use 'Q' to close the program, and 'W' to reset the wind.

Fence height and fence distance can be modified within the file, variables shown at the top.

Enjoy the game!
